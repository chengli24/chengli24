Welcome to my homepage. I am now a MPhil student at the Hong Kong Universiy of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by [Assistant Prof. Dasa Gu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NUV28h8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Chair Prof. Alexis Kai Hon Lau](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sB519ukAAAAJ&hl=en) (Head of ENVR, HKUST).  

I will be a PhD Student at HKUST, majored in IIP (Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) as a PhD Student in 2026 Fall, supervised by [Assistant Prof. Dasa Gu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NUV28h8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Chair Prof. Pan Hui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dcDrhzMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) (IEEE Fellow, MAE, FREng and ACM Distinguished Scientist) (IEEE会士，欧洲科学院院士，英国皇家工程院外籍院士，ACM杰出科学家)， co-supervised by [Prof. Daren Lu (Daren Lyu or Daren Lv)](https://iap.cas.cn/sourcedb/zw/gbzjrc/ys/200908/t20090805_5548911.html)（Academician of Chineses Academy of Sciences) (中国科学院院士), [Prof. Ruizhi Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ViEjhlsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN)  (member of the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters, Previous Director of State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing) (芬兰人文与科学院院士, 测绘遥感信息工程国家重点实验室前主任) and [Prof. Xiangyun Hu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MVFNsJgAAAAJ&hl=en) (Head of the Department of Photogrammetry, WHU) (武汉大学摄影测量系主任).  

My reseach interests focuse on Remote Sensing, Computer Vision, Autonomous Driving and Machine Learning. I am also a research assistant at AIR, Tsinghua University and an intern autonomous driving algorithm engineer in Lightwheel Inc. advised by [Assistant Prof. Zhao Hao](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1046/1652.htm). I am selected as the Asian Future Leaders Program (AFLSP) from 2024-2026 (100 students from Asian top University Per Year). I received my bachelor degree in computer science from Macau University of Science and Technology (MUST) with the President Medalist Award in MUST and supervised by [Prof. Xiaolin Tian](https://fie.must.edu.mo/id-1444/person/view/id-539.html).

Publications
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one Markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a Markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each Markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

For more info
------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.

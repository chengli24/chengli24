Welcome to my homepage. I am currently now a MPhil student at the Hong Kong Universiy of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by [Associate Prof. Dasa Gu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NUV28h8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Chair Prof. Alexis Kai Hon Lau](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sB519ukAAAAJ&hl=en) (JP, Head of ENVR, HKUST).  

I will be a PhD Student at HKUST, majored in IIP (AI, Data Science and Remote Sensing) as a PhD Student in 2026 Fall, supervised by [Associate Prof. Dasa Gu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NUV28h8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Chair Prof. Pan Hui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dcDrhzMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) (IEEE Fellow, MAE, FREng and ACM Distinguished Scientist) (IEEE会士，欧洲科学院院士，英国皇家工程院外籍院士，ACM杰出科学家)， co-supervised by [Prof. Daren Lyu (Daren Lu or Daren Lv)](https://iap.cas.cn/sourcedb/zw/gbzjrc/ys/200908/t20090805_5548911.html)（Academician of Chineses Academy of Sciences) (中国科学院院士), [Prof. Delu Pan](https://ocac.zju.edu.cn/2020/0509/c50525a2094491/pagem.htm)（Academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering) (中国工程院院士) and [Prof. Peng Chen](http://www.sdioi.com/ryxx/1541.html) (中国国家优青).  

I also fortunately work closely and co-advised by [Prof. Liangpei Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vzj2hcYAAAAJ&hl=en) (IEEE Fellow, IET Fellow, 长江讲座教授), [Prof. Ruizhi Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ViEjhlsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN)  (member of the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters, Previous Director of State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing) (芬兰人文与科学院院士, 测绘遥感信息工程国家重点实验室前主任), [Prof. Xiangyun Hu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MVFNsJgAAAAJ&hl=en) (Head of the Department of Photogrammetry, WHU) (二级教授, 武汉大学摄影测量系主任), and [Prof. Hui Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=utTxEzYAAAAJ&hl=zh-TW) (FIEAS, FAcSS) (国际亚欧科学院院士, 英国社会科学院院士) during my PhD period.  

My reseach interests focuse on Remote Sensing, Computer Vision, Autonomous Driving and Machine Learning. I am also a research assistant at AIR, Tsinghua University and an intern LLM autonomous driving algorithm engineer in Li Auto Inc. and Shanghai Innovation Institute advised by [Assistant Prof. Zhao Hao](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1046/1652.htm), [Assistant Prof. Hongyang Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Hfrih1EAAAAJ&hl=en), [Dr. Zhihui Hao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E1aaa_kAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and Mr. Gaoqiang Wu. I am selected as the Asian Future Leader Scholarship Program (AFLSP) from 2024-2026 (100 students from Asian top University Per Year). I received my bachelor degree in computer science from Macau University of Science and Technology (MUST) with the President Medalist Award in MUST and supervised by [Prof. Xiaolin Tian](https://fie.must.edu.mo/id-1444/person/view/id-539.html). My Bachelor GPA at MUST is 3.84/4.00, my MPhil Culmulative Grade Point Average (CGA) at HKUST is 4.30/4.30.
